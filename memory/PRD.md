## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS, shadcn UI components
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLite (aiosqlite)
- **AI Chat**: Groq with openai/gpt-oss-20b
- **AI STT**: Groq with whisper-large-v3-turbo
- **AI TTS**: OpenAI TTS HD API (direct)
- **AI Images**: APIFree.ai with ByteDance Seedream 4.5
- **Voice Profiles**: 23 custom voices with .wav samples
- **Design**: "Organic & Earthy" theme — Playfair Display, cream/charcoal palette
- **Repo**: https://github.com/smcantrellbooks/nyxen-ai

## Roles
- **Publisher Workspace (Home Base)**: Full-service creative writing assistant — helps write, edit, structure manuscripts, generate content when asked
- **Other Pages (Voice Studio, Images, etc.)**: Assistive only — guides, suggests, helps with choices but does NOT control tools or auto-execute
- **Standalone**: Full Nyxen chat at /nyxen route
- **Future**: Will connect to smcantrellbooks.com

## Core Principle
User is ALWAYS in control. Nyxen suggests, assists, and enhances. She does NOT auto-generate, override selections, control tools, or force workflows. She sits alongside the user, not between them and the system.
